# Description
An attempt at creating a resume in a more unique way. Using a JSON schema, inspired by https://github.com/jsonresume, and wrapping it in a react.js webpage to create a resume that can be easily hosted and downloaded. I will also be setting up a process for exporting to pdf to access on the website and use for general applications.
