# Description
My personal resume built using a JSON Schema that is wrapped inside of a React webpage.
Each part of the resume can be altered through the json file to edit text or add more elements and notes. 

I created this to eliminate a problem I had where everytime I went to edit my last resume, I had to go back into
photoshop and modify each visual element. Now it can be generated via the data provided in the JSON and reorganized 
through the React Components. Current modularity is not perfect, and more sections and options to reorganize will be
added in the future.
